# Udacity's Responsive Web Design Fundamentals - ud893

##Course Summary
In this course I learned the fundamentals of responsive web design with Google's Pete LePage! I created my own responsive web page that works well on any device - phone, tablet, desktop or anything in between.

I started by exploring what makes a site responsive and how some common responsive design patterns work across different devices. From there, I learned how to create my own responsive layout using the viewport tag and CSS media queries. Finally, I experimented with major and minor breakpoints, and optimizing text for reading.
  
##Why I took this course
The way people browse the web is changing quickly - fewer and fewer users access the web at a desk in front of a large monitor with a keyboard and mouse. The web is increasingly being enjoyed on phones, tablets, wearables, TVs and everything in between. By designing a site to be responsive, it will look good and work well no matter what device my users have in front of them.

Throughout this course, I worked through a project. I created a home town website that works well on phones, tablets and desktop displays.

##Course Syllabus
###Lesson 1 - Why Responsive?

What is responsive web design and why is it important? What kinds of devices should we be targeting with our design? How can we best leverage the different capabilities of each device to provide great experiences to users? It also made sure that my development environment was ready to go.

**Topics covered:**
* What is responsive design?
* Why does responsive design work for any device?
* Remote debugging and emulation in the browser

**Other Takeaways**
* How to set up debugging in the browser on desktop and android devices.

###Lesson 2 - Starting Small

The best way to get started is to start small and build up. In this lesson, we covered the key components that make a site great on a small screen, including setting the viewport, adding content and sizing the content to the viewport. I started the home town site project, by making sure that it looks good on a small screen.

**Topics covered:**
* Why start small and build up?
* What is the viewport?
* Sizing the content to the viewport
  * avoiding static sized items
* Touch target, and why they should be large

**Other Takeaways**
* Device independent pixels vs Hardware pixels
* Device pixel ratios (hardware pixels over dip)
* width=device-width allows the page to reflow  content to match the device
* initial-scale=1 tells the browser to match the DIP and CSS pixels to a 1:1 ratio
* **Dont forget to set the viewport** using
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">`
* Make sure pictures don't overflow the viewport by putting this code in your css

```
img, embed, object, video {
	max-width: 100%
}
```
* Tap targets should be 48px by 48px minimum so they are bigger than people's thumbs with fat fingers.
```
nav a, button {
	min-width: 48px;
	min-height: 48px;
}
```
* Design from the ground up: wearble to phone to tablet to desktop to tv (or however far you need to go)

####L2 Assignment
- [X] Add a <meta> viewport to the page with initial scale set.
- [X] Adjust CSS and markup so that everything displays in a single column. Use relative widths so that things stretch to fit across any viewport width.
- [X] Make sure your touch targets are easy to hit
- [X] Test your site across different viewports. Try it on different phones, tablets, and desktops.

###Lesson 3 - Building Up

Since I had gotten the page optimized for small screens, it was now time to start thinking about how theyâ€™ll look on larger screens. I learned how to use CSS media queries to add breakpoints that change the layout depending on the screen size or other device characteristics.

**Topics covered:**
* CSS media queries
* What is a breakpoint, and how to choose one
* Using the CSS flexbox to modify layout

**Other Takeaways**
* Media queries.
 * Linked style sheet: mini small http requests
   * ```<link rel="stylesheet" media="screen and (min-width: 500px)" href="green.css">```
 * @media tag: few big http requests
   * ```@media screen and (min-width:500px) { body {background-color: green; }}```
 * Two media tags at once
   * ```@media screen and (min-width:500px) { body {color: #F79420; }}  
        @media screen and (min-width:800px) { body {background-color: blue; }}```

###Lesson 4 - Common Responsive Patterns

With the basics of responsive design down, I went on to learn about and practice some of the common layout design patterns used across sites. Also, I iterated on the home town site project, creating breakpoints for tablet and desktop layouts using the patterns from this lesson.

**Topics covered:**
* Mostly fluid pattern
* Column drop pattern
* Layout shifter pattern
* Off canvas pattern

###Lesson 5 - Optimizations

I learned strategies for minor breakpoints used to adjust the margins or padding on an element, or increase the font size to make it feel more natural in the layout. Also, I learned about strategies for dealing with tables and optimal text readability. At the end of the lesson, I iterated for the last time on the home town site, adding minor breakpoints to really make the experience stand out.

**Topics covered:**
* Minor break points
* Optimizing text layout
  * font size
  * optimal line length
* Responsive tables, and strategies for dealing with them
